# Expense Tracker app using ReactJS

This is a simple expense tracker app where the user can add his daily expenses. 

All the expense information are stored in array and we are handling all the states and providing state information using [useReducer()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) and [useContext()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext) hooks provided by ReactJS.
